	Linux Termlink tries to make the terminal emulator appear like the terminals from the video game "Fallout". It is a bashrc file, which modifies the prompts that the appear when using your terminal emulator. When the terminal editor is opened, this modification shows the "Debug" screen from the terminals in the game, then displays a command prompt that tries to emulate the style of the game. 

  !!! Warning: May need to edit the last line to include your username !!!
