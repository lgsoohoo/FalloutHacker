	Hacker Bot is a program written to help players with the hacking minigame in "Fallout". After entering in the list of possible passwords, users can enter in the 'test password' they chose, followed by the number of characters that were correct (location AND letter). The program then automatically eliminates all invalid words, and displays the remaining possible answers.

	Some notes:
===========================

 All possible passwords must be the same length
 Type '.del' to delete an entered possible password
 Type '.start' to begin testing passwords
 Password attempts must be from the list
